(not) soon to be an custom [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) Minecraft take for the version 1.18.2 of said game.

archipelago, give me my kids back.

# TODO LIST!!!!

- Make the logic go logic
- Get the Python also do the logic, because I don't know how to code.
- make deathlink work (again).
- Make some stuff more toggeable (Because, we love mods!)
- Make compabilities work for mods, because, Imagine being able to *Create* the heck outta of the BK!

## Optional stuff to do

- Get the [Gift thingie](https://github.com/agilbert1412/Archipelago.Gifting.Net) working, because it would be cute to be able to.
- Custom advancements, because, why not?
- Make it able to run on Client, because not everyone knows how to set up a server, even with the APMC file.
- speaking of, should I even make the APMC file also? Or should I just ignore it rightfully so?
- Compabilities with the new Archipelago client. Checking more stuff than just the chat and the hints would be nice.
- Entrance Randomizer (Because, going into the Nether portal to pop out in the Twilight Forest would be fun as fuck).

# Ok, so, when whill this be done?
dunno. might be avaiable for the year 26, not that much.
